# Heart Failure Prediction  

Welcome to the **Heart Failure Prediction** project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting heart failure using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to develop models that help identify the risk of heart failure based on patient data, enabling early detection and effective management.

## Project Overview  

Heart failure is a severe condition, but its impact can be reduced through early detection and proactive care. This project uses machine learning algorithms to:  
- Analyze patient data.  
- Predict the likelihood of heart failure.  
- Assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Data  

The dataset used for this project is the **Heart Failure Prediction Dataset** from Kaggle. It includes patient attributes that are critical for heart failure analysis, such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.  

---

## Dataset Features  

The dataset consists of the following attributes:  
1. **Age**  
2. **Sex**  
3. **Chest Pain Type** (4 values)  
4. **Resting Blood Pressure**  
5. **Serum Cholesterol** (mg/dl)  
6. **Fasting Blood Sugar** (> 120 mg/dl)  
7. **Resting Electrocardiographic Results** (values: 0, 1, 2)  
8. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**  
9. **Exercise-Induced Angina**  
10. **Oldpeak** (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)  
11. **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**  
12. **Number of Major Vessels** (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy  
13. **Thalassemia (Thal)**:  
    - 0 = Normal  
    - 1 = Fixed Defect  
    - 2 = Reversible Defect
