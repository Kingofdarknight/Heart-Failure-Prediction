# Heart-Failure-Prediction

Welcome to the Heart Failure Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting heart failure using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can predict the likelihood of heart failure based on patient data.

# Project Overview

Heart failure is a critical condition that can be managed more effectively with early detection. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the risk of heart failure. The focus is on developing models that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

# Data

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. It contains various patient attributes such as age, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol levels.

# Dataset Features

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
